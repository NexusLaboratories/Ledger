# Project Documentation

This folder contains developer and architecture documentation for the `ledger` app.

Files:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — high-level design and patterns
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` — setup, running and development guidance
- `CI.md` — sample GitHub Actions workflow

Additions you might want:
- `ONBOARDING.md` — for new contributors
- `EXAMPLES.md` — adding real-world integration examples
- `CHANGELOG.md` — tracking releases and changes

If you'd like me to add any of those, tell me which and I'll scaffold them.
